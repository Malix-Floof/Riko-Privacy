# Privacy Policy for Riko

**Last Updated:** December 18, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how our Discord Bot ("the Bot") collects, uses, and handles your information. By adding the Bot to your server, you agree to the terms described below.

### 1. Data Collection
The Bot only accesses information that is technically necessary for its operation:
* **User Identifiers:** User IDs and Usernames.
* **Context Identifiers:** Server (Guild) IDs and Channel IDs.
* **Message Content:** Only when processed for AI-related functions.

### 2. How We Use Data
The collected data is used exclusively to:
* Identify users and servers to apply specific settings.
* Process AI requests and deliver responses to the correct channel.
* Ensure the security and stability of the Bot.

### 3. Data Retention and Deletion
We prioritize your privacy and minimize data storage:
* **No Long-term Storage:** We do NOT store your message history or AI conversation logs in any permanent database.
* **24-Hour Deletion:** All temporary data and session information are automatically and permanently deleted within **24 hours**.
* **No Data Selling:** We never sell, trade, or share your personal data with third parties for marketing purposes.

### 4. Third-Party Services
To provide AI functionality, the Bot may transmit text data to AI service providers (such as OpenAI or Anthropic). This data is sent via encrypted channels and is subject to the respective provider's privacy policies.

### 5. User Rights
Since we do not store message history longer than 24 hours, there is no persistent personal archive to delete. If you wish to stop data processing, you may simply remove the Bot from your server.

### 6. Contact
If you have any questions regarding this policy, please contact the developer via Discord: https://discord.gg/NVwzEPqwqq
